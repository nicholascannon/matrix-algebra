# CITS3402 Project 1: Matrix Multiplication

Written by Nicholas Cannon (22241579)

## Make commands

- `make` -> compiles and builds executable
- `make run` -> runs executable in ./bin
- `make clean` -> cleans project (removes object files)

**NOTE**
May need to change the `CC` value in makefile. I'm running on osx and had to use gcc-9 as gcc is just a symlink to clang on osx =(
